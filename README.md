# Challenge 01

## Description
This page was used to practice HTML semantic structure and condensing the associated CSS file. Accessibility was also improved by writing <code>alt</code> tags with descriptions of the images. Many lines of CSS code were repetitive and able to be combined into fewer rules. Use of the <code>section</code> tag in index.html eliminated repetitive and vague <code>div</code> tags.
